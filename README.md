### Managing Workspaces

Workspace administrators are able to:

* Control who can create channels or add apps

* Limit posting permissions in #general

**Pro Tip**: You can join multiple workspaces — click your profile image and select **Add another workspace**.

## Mastering Channels and Conversations

Channels are the backbone of Slack’s communication, keeping discussions organized by topic, department, or project.

### Types of Channels

* **Public Channels**: Accessible to all workspace members (e.g., #design-team)

* **Private Channels**: Only visible to invited participants

* **Shared Channels**: Facilitate collaboration between members of different organizations within a single channel

### Channel Actions

* **Create**: Click `+` next to Channels > Create a channel

* **Join**: Browse channels or use `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` to find one

* **Mute**: Type `/mute` or go to settings > Mute this channel

* **Archive**: Navigate to settings > Additional options > Archive this channel

### Threads

Threads help maintain clarity and context:

* Reply within a thread to keep discussions organized

* Select "Also send to #channel" to notify the main channel if needed

### Direct and Group Messaging

* DMs: Private one-to-one messages

* Group DMs: Private chats with up to 9 participants

## Voice, Video, and Screen Sharing

Slack supports both native and integrated solutions for voice and video calls.

### Native Calls

* Initiate a call by clicking the **phone** or **camera** icon in a DM

* On paid plans, host group calls with up to 15 participants

### Features

* Share your screen instantly

* Use the pencil icon to annotate during screen sharing

* Add more participants into ongoing calls

### Using / Commands

* `/call` – starts a Slack-native call if supported

* `/zoom` or `/meet` – launches Zoom or Google Meet sessions

### Recording via Standuply

Use `/voice` or `/video` to record a message. It will be uploaded to a private YouTube link and automatically shared in Slack.

## Optimizing Your Slack Profile and Availability

Your profile lets teammates understand who you are, your role, and your current availability.

### Setting Up Your Profile

* Click your name > *Profile & account* > Edit Profile

* Customizable fields include:

  * Display name
  * Job title and team
  * Status message (e.g., "Working remotely", "Out of office")
  * Time zone
  * Profile picture (recommended: 512x512 px)

### Status & Availability

* Update your status manually or integrate apps like Google Calendar via Zapier

* Use emojis for quick visual status indicators

* Enable Do Not Disturb to pause notifications

**Pro Tip**: Set status expiration timers so your status reverts automatically after a set period.
